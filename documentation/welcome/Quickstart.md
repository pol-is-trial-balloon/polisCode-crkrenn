# Quickstart

You can have your first Polis conversation up and tweeted in less than a minute. Here's how.

1. [Create an account](https://pol.is/createuser)
2. In the [inbox](https://pol.is/inbox), click [+new](https://pol.is/conversation/create)
3. Give your conversation a topic and description
4. Decide what flavor of [moderation](../usage/CommentModeration.md) you'd like, lazy or strict
5. Click create
6. Paste the share link (it will look something like pol.is/55555) into an email, a tweet, etc.
7. Go to your conversation, watch responses roll in, etc.

##### Important

Strict moderation mode will prevent all commments from being shown.
Make sure to moderate comments into the conversation!
If your conversation is pol.is/55555, your admin console can be found at pol.is/**m**/55555.
