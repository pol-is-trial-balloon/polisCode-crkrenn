# Who gets shown?

The visualization is potentially different for every user. There is a hierarchy of who get shown. Our algorithm follows the following priority:

1. Featured (if you've featured any participants)
2. Facebook friends (provided the participant has connected Facebook)
3. Participants with verified Twitter accounts
4. Participants with the most Twitter followers
5. Random Facebook accounts

The first priority are users you have decided to feature. To feature / remove users:
