# What we compute

Every pol.is conversation produces a trove of data:

* a collection of comments
* for each participant and comment that participant voted on, the precise vote
* every unique browser/user visit to the conversation
* for each participant, the opinion group they belong to
* for each opinion group, the comments standing out as important to that group
* the opinions most widely shared across _all_ groups
* for users who connect socially via Twitter or Facebook, we also get that user's social profile


While most of this data is somehow represented via pol.is' user interface, this data is significantly compressed to make it easy to quickly understand it all.
However, for those looking to do deeper analyses of that data that pol.is produces, we offer data export functionality.
