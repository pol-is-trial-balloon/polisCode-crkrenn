# Using Polis data

There are many powerful things you can do with the data exported from pol.is.
Below are just some basic ideas you can play with to get the ideas flowing.


## Analytics data

Analytics data can be a really powerful tool for measuring engagement.
When we track the behavior of average internet users, we see significantly increased engagement with pol.is over traditional commenting systems.
Our analytics data provides a way of demonstrating these tangible benefits to whomever might be interested: company executives, advertising interests, etc.


## Cross-reference pol.is data with data you already have about participants

One of the most powerful things you can do with polis data is to correlate it with data you already have about your users.
For instance, if there are 4 groups, try correlating the members of each group with gender, length of employment, geographic distribution, etc.
You can now start to see how the data you have about users correlates with the results of the conversation.

We're interested in weaving some of these features more directly into pol.is PLUS in the near future.
If there's something you'd like to see, and/or if you're interested in getting early access to the features we're building, please [contact us](mailto:contact@pol.is).
