# Moderation

**Strict mode** no comments go out unless you have approved them to be shown.

**Lazy mode** all comments go out to users, but can be moderated out after the fact.

Polis has a built-in **profanity filter** you can toggle on and off. The profanity filter will automatically moderate out comments that contain profanity.

To moderate comments:

`pol.is/m/55555 >> Comments >> TODO`

Note that rejected comments cannot be moderated back into the conversation, but that you can copy and paste it back in as a seed comment.

To turn on / off strict moderation:

`pol.is/m/55555 >> Config >> Strict Moderation`

To turn on / off profanity filter:

`pol.is/m/55555 >> Config >> Profanity Filter`
