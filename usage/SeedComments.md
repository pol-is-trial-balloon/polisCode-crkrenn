# Seed Comments

It's good practice to start the conversation off with a few comments for participants to react to.
That doesn't always mean that you want to be a member of the conversation yourself.
This is especially true if you are submitting comments on both sides of the issue to offer some diversity of opinion (recommended).

Instead of writing as a participant, you can use the form under ‘seed comments’ in the admin panel.
This allows you to add comments to the conversation without voting on them.

Seed comments are different from comments submitted by participants.
* they are not associated with an account
* there is no initial vote associated with them
