# Default Settings

Polis is highly configurable. Learning the defaults is a great way to get a sense of what you can do.

Setting | Default | Description
---|:---:|---
Strict moderation | **off** |  If strict moderation is turned off, all comments are eligible to be shown as soon as they are submitted by a participant. If strict moderation is turned on, *no* comments will be shown until approved.
Comment form | **on** | If the comment form is *on*, participants *will* be able to write comments. If the comment form is *off*, participants will not be able to submit comments. Only comments already in the system or seed comments will be shown.
Visualization | **on** | Show the visualization to participants, or don't.
Social login buttons | **on** | Show Twitter and Facebook buttons underneath visualization and comment form, or don't. More generally, prompt users to sign into Polis. Users who are already signed in with social will remain signed in.
Social share buttons | **on** | Show social share buttons on the top of the UI. Disabled by default when embedded, as you probably don't want to share a link back to pol.is/55555 but to your site. We assume in the embedded scenario that you are.
Embed code shown to users |  **off** | Allow users to embed your conversation on their own site. Think of YouTube video embedding.
